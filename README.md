# Rust Guessing Game

This is a simple guessing game implemented in Rust. It is based on the example provided in the Rust Book, a comprehensive guide to the Rust programming language.

## Gameplay

The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player's objective is to guess the correct number. The player is given hints about their guess being too high or too low, helping them to narrow down the correct answer. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number.
